<Warning>

The End of Life (EOL) date of Rules and Hooks will be **November 18, 2026**, and they are no longer available to new tenants created as of **October 16, 2023**. Existing tenants with active Hooks will retain Hooks product access through end of life.

We highly recommend that you use Actions to extend Auth0. With Actions, you have access to rich type information, inline documentation, and public `npm` packages, and can connect external integrations that enhance your overall extensibility experience. To learn more about what Actions offer, read [Understand How Auth0 Actions Work](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

To help with your migration, we offer guides that will help you [migrate from Rules to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions) and [migrate from Hooks to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-hooks-to-actions). We also have a dedicated [Move to Actions](https://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) page that highlights feature comparisons, [an Actions demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesFSY1klrI), and other resources to help you on your migration journey.

To read more about the Rules and Hooks deprecation, read our blog post: [Preparing for Rules and Hooks End of Life](https://auth0.com/blog/preparing-for-rules-and-hooks-end-of-life/).

</Warning>

You can append [Rules](/docs/customize/rules) to the pre-configured authorization policy to exercise additional control over permitting or denying user access. A rule contains custom code that makes an authorization decision based on appropriate logic. When combined with other rules, it helps define what happens in different contexts.

ルールを使用すると、ユーザーの部署、時刻、位置、その他のAPI属性（ユーザー名、セキュリティクリアランス、API名など）といった、ユーザーに保管している属性の組み合わせを基にアクセスを制限し、より細かく制御できるようになります。

たとえば、ある非営利団体でルールを使ってアクセスをきめ細かく制御している場合、ニューデリー支社にある研究開発部の正規従業員にのみアプリケーションへのアクセス許可を与えることができます。

For samples of rule implementations with authorization policies, read [Sample Use Cases: Rules with Authorization](/docs/manage-users/access-control/sample-use-cases-rules-with-authorization).

## 認可プロセスでのルール

Based on the order in which they run, rules can change the outcome of the authorization decision prior to the permissions being added to the <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+Token">Access Token</Tooltip>. The basic process with rules injected is as follows:

1. The user tries to authenticate with the application.
2. Auth0 brings the request to the selected identity provider.
3. Once the identity provider confirms that user credentials are valid, all created rules run in the order in which they are configured in the Dashboard.
4. Assuming no rule has restricted the user's access, the user is authorized to access the application.
