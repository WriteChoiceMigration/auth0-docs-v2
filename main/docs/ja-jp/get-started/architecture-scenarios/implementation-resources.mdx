Auth0には、製品やコミュニティと効果的な連携できる豊富なリソースが備えられています。このリストには、カテゴリー別に利用できるリソースのリンクがあります。

## はじめに

Auth0には、基本機能の学習に役立つ以下のようなリソースがあります。

* [**Getting Started documentation**](/docs/get-started): Explore the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> and common terms used for components of the Auth0 service. Gain a broad understanding of Auth0 and learn the terminology you might hear when working with Auth0 staff or reading our docs.
* [**Architecture scenarios**](/docs/get-started/architecture-scenarios): Review common architecture scenarios and learn how to implement them with Auth0. Scenarios include tutorials for common architecture patterns, such as a Single-Page Application (SPA) calling an API. High-level descriptions are useful for architects, while tutorials will help development teams.
* [**Implementation guides**](/docs/): 学習する how to implement commonly-used features, such as user management and <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=multi-factor+authentication">multi-factor authentication</Tooltip> (MFA). This information is useful for both architects and developers

## 学習する

Auth0は、学習と詳細を素早く確認できる各種のチュートリアルやガイド、ホワイトペーパー、ブログ投稿などを提供しています。

* [**Docs site**](/docs/): Browse through our docs to explore a wealth of available topics, or use our search to quickly find content related to a topic or term.
* [**Feature descriptions and white papers**](https://auth0.com/learn/): Investigate short descriptions of features, industry case studies, and reference white papers. The Auth0 学習する site provides a quick overview of Auth0 features and their business value; it is helpful for project owners as well as architects and developers.
* [**Blog posts**](https://auth0.com/blog/): Read blog posts written by experts on a variety of topics--from time-honored advice to breaking news in the identity space. Many blog posts are oriented toward architects and developers.

## サンプルコードを実行する

開発チームで構築の準備が整ったら、Auth0提供のサンプルプログラム、SKDやライブラリーを使ってプロジェクトを速やかに勧めることができます。

* [**Quickstarts**](/docs/quickstarts): Investigate a rich array of small sample programs that demonstrate how to implement the key features you’ll want to include in your program, such as authentication, session management, profile updates, and logout. Quickstarts will give developers a head start on understanding how to integrate applications with Auth0.
* [Libraries and SDKs](/docs/libraries): Simplify your custom application development by using our extensive set of libraries and SDKs, which abstract many of the details of identity protocols for you. Auth0 SDKs support numerous languages and frameworks to simplify your integration with Auth0. We also provide a library for Lock, a login widget, that you can use across several platforms, including iOS and Android.
* [**Management API**](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2): Explore and manipulate objects, configurations, and settings within Auth0. The <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> Explorer allows you to quickly manipulate individual objects and settings on an ad-hoc basis and test API calls before coding them into your applications.
* [**Authentication API**](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication): Authenticate and authorize users via the OIDC, <Tooltip tip="OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OAuth">OAuth</Tooltip>, and <Tooltip tip="OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=SAML">SAML</Tooltip> protocols. The Authentication API Explorer allows you to experiment with authentication and <Tooltip tip="Authorization Flow: Authorization grant (or workflow) specified in the OAuth 2.0 framework." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=authorization+flows">authorization flows</Tooltip>, and test API calls before coding them into your applications.

## 機能とAPI呼び出しを試す

構築では、Auth0にあるさまざな製品機能を試してテストすることができます。

* **［TRY（試す）］ボタン/リンク**：Auth0の製品機能をすばやく試すことができます。**［TRY（試す）］**ボタンはAuth0のいたる所にあり、接続、ルール、フックやメールテンプレートを試すことができます。
* [**Authentication API Explorer**](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#introduction): Experiment with authentication and authorization flows, and test API calls before coding them into your applications.
* [**Management API Explorer**](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2): Quickly manipulate individual objects and settings on an ad-hoc basis and test API calls before coding them into your applications.

## ヘルプを求める

Auth0には、実装のトラブルシューティングに役立つ以下のリソースがあります。

* [**Auth0 Community forum**](https://community.auth0.com/): Connect with the world of Auth0 via Auth0 posts, FAQs, and community Q&As. Architects and developers find this a valuable source of information for learning and connecting with others as well as getting help on issues.
* [**Support Center**](https://support.auth0.com/): View and manage your subscription and tenants, file and view support requests, run automated production checks on a tenant, and view compliance information. Paid subscribers will find the support center a valuable resource if an issue or question cannot be solved by documentation or by searching the forum.

  + [**Create support cases**](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/open-and-manage-support-tickets): Create and file a support case if you need help.
  + [**Support Plans and Service Level Agreements**](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support#defect-responses): 学習する about multiple levels of support available for purchase.
  + [**Troubleshooting tips**](/docs/deploy-monitor/deploy-private-cloud/private-cloud-on-aws#what-to-check-before-logging-an-issue) and [**Information to include in your support case**](/docs/deploy-monitor/deploy-private-cloud/private-cloud-on-aws#information-to-provide-when-logging-an-issue): Get advice to help your development and support teams analyze issues.
* [**Supported versions**](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/product-support-matrix): Understand which versions of SDKs, browsers, and languages are supported. Architects and developers should review this to ensure your project employs languages, libraries, and SDKs that will allow your implementation to work with Auth0.
* [**Feedback Portal**](https://auth0.com/feedback): Make product suggestions. (You can also do this via the Support Center if you want better visibility into what you’ve filed over time.) Architects and developers can use this site to provide feedback on the Auth0 product for consideration as enhancements in the future.
* [**Professional Services**](/docs/get-started/professional-services): Engage our world-wide professional services team to help speed your project to success. Project owners will find this useful for learning how Auth0 identity experts can help accelerate your project or fill in any temporary skill gaps.

## 処理をセットアップして監視する

立ち上げを計画する準備が整ったら、以下のAuth0リソースが役に立ちます。
